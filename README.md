# LemonLace

Extending the bootstrap 3 grid system with fractional columns, extra gutter classes and much much more!

This is to work intrinsically with bootstrap 3 and and ideally ought to be loaded in as a bower plugin.

## Dependencies

Certain base mixins commonly used, such as xs, sm-plus, etc. Not currently publically.. published.

## Install (any of:)

	yarn add lemonlace
	npm install --save lemonlace
	bower install --save lemonlace


## Add To Your Project

You can import the sass in a similar fashion to, any of:

	@import '../bower_components/lemonlace/scss/lemonlace';
	@import 'node_modules/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome';

Typically, you would include it AFTER bootstrap, but BEFORE your site's custom styles.
