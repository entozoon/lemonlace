# LemonLace
Extending the bootstrap 3 grid system with fractional columns, extra gutter classes and much much more!

This is to work intrinsically with bootstrap 3 and ideally ought to be loaded in as a bower plugin.

## Install (any of:)

	yarn add lemonlace
	npm install --save lemonlace
	bower install --save lemonlace


## Add To Your Project

You can import the sass in a similar fashion to, any of:

	@import "../bower_components/lemonlace/scss/lemonlace";


Typically, you would include it AFTER bootstrap, but BEFORE your site's custom styles.
